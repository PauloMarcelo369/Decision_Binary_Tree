# Decision_Binary_Tree
In this algorithm, a tree structure is constructed by reading a file named "Symptoms.txt". This file contains a dataset describing the number of diseases and symptoms, their names, and how symptoms relate to diseases. The expected format for the dataset follows a specific pattern: the first line provides two integers, x and y, representing the total number of diseases and symptoms, respectively. Following this, there should be x lines with the names of diseases and y lines with the names of symptoms. Subsequently, the remaining lines in the file follow a different pattern: each line consists of a number from 1 to x, identifying the ID of the disease to which the set of symptoms refers, followed by y values (0 or 1) separated by spaces. The value 1 indicates that the symptom is associated with that disease, while 0 indicates it is not.
For example, in the initial lines of the file, there would be information about the total number of diseases and symptoms, followed by the names of diseases and symptoms, and then the relationship between symptoms and diseases would be described in the subsequent lines.
